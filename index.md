Hello, there. Welcome to my website! My name is Yu Ding, or in Chinese, 丁玉, which literally means “jade.” I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. My research focuses on understanding cancer heterogeneity and tumor evolution through machine learning.

I received my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Industrial and Systems Engineering from [State University of New York at Binghamton](https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/) in 2024, advised by Dr. [Bing Si](https://search.asu.edu/profile/1842897) (now at Arizona State University). My Ph.D. dissertation is [Statistical Machine Learning and Data Fusion Methodologies: Applications in Healthcare](https://www.proquest.com/openview/07ec66b181b60f436ca80c2fe96053c0). I obtained my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Geophysics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2017.
